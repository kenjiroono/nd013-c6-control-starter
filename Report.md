### Add the plots to your report and explain them (describe what you see)

- The following figure shows the steering error and steering output.
The steering error gets greater when the ego-car detects the stationary cars and plans to go around them. 
However, severe oscillation is observed when driving straight without any obstacles ahead. This shows that 
the PID controller is not converging to the target lane and oscillate along the target lane.

- The following figure show continuous osciallation in error throttle which will not provide smooth experience. The parameters needs to be further tuned

### What is the effect of the PID according to the plots, how each part of the PID affects the control command?

We need PID controller doesn't overshoot and minimizes the error in a short range of time. PID controller can minimize 
the mistake between expect and actual speed / yaw angle of the vehicle by producing control output. Within this project 
the PID parameters were adjust to keep the drive smooth.

- <b>P</b> is a proportional controller that provides an output proportional to the current error. P controller compares the set 
point with the actual value or the reference and the resulting error is multiplied with a proportional constant to get 
the output and requires biasing to provide stable operation and always maintains the steady-state error. When P gain increases 
the better performance of the vehicle if we start too far away from the desired trajectory with a high gain the car can spin out of control.

- <b>I</b> is an integral controller that helps to reduce time to minimize the cross track error. It integrates the error signal over
a certain period of time until the error signal is down to zero. This controller decreases the output when a negative error takes place. 
As the gain of the I- Controller decreases, the steady-state error also decreases.

- <b>D</b> is a derivative controller for ease of the error rate to reduce the overshooting and improves the stability of the system by 
compensation increasing the derivative, gain increases the speed of the response. If the D gain is too low will cause the car to 
be underdamped and still oscillate if the D gain is too high will cause overdamped and take a long time to correct offsets. 
A good D gain can approach the desired trajectory quickly with a cross-track error rate close to zero this is so-called critically damped.  



### How would you design a way to automatically tune the PID parameters?

- Implementing twiddle algorithm to optimize a set of parameters which was covered in PID control Parameter Optimization lesson. By offering 
initial values for the PID parameters and probing intervals we can run the PID controller and analyze the control output and tweaking the 
parameters up and down by examining the outcome, calculates the new quality marker and replaces the parameters only if the result is better.



### PID controller is a model free controller, i.e. it does not use a model of the car. Could you explain the pros and cons of this type of controller?

- Pros: PID controller can run in real-time making it idealized for self-driving cars no need to understand the system, adapted to a complex system, 
computationally more efficient. It's broadly known and widely used within the industry like temperature and ph control. Temperature control of 
Furnace which is used for heating at high temperatures has a high quantity of inertia to moderately stable signal for fault detection. PH control 
is widely viewed in the industry as to control. PID Controllers are mostly used in converters. and can be connected to numerous distinctive issues, 
not only steering and throttle control. 
- Cons: The only disadvantage is the tuning methodology. Difficult interpretation of the controllerâ€™s behaviour, cannot predict how the system will 
react to an unknown situation. Tuning or learning the controller using data can be slow. Uncertainty of the controller (no guarantees)
